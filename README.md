# WAE
Web Application Environment is a python based platform for downloading applications to ram.

# Why should i use WAE?
1. For updating applictions easily without wait times
2. Great for easily getting apps running with no download

# Why shouldn't i use WAE?
Not really any reasons why aside from ram intensiveness and if you are using pip currently the user has install of them by hand (which will be fixed build v201). If you have fix please make a pull request.

# What makes WAE development diffrently from regular python?
Diffrences of including other python files that are not from pip you will need to use the api's Include() function. Used like this `Include("lib.py")`

# What if want to know what im working on for this project?
It will be included in this readme if you have a working build or prototyope for the update.

# How does the version system work?
